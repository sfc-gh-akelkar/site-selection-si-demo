## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific when needed** — Include study IDs (e.g., MED-ONC-2024-001) or site names for targeted queries
2. **Ask follow-up questions** — The agent maintains context, so you can drill down naturally
3. **Combine domains** — Ask questions that span both structured metrics and protocol documents
4. **Request explanations** — Ask "What does X mean?" for any unfamiliar terms
